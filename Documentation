The Elevator Maintenance Contract contains several functions to manage elevator maintenance tasks. Below is a brief overview of each function and its purpose:

"createMaintenanceTask(address _elevator, uint _scheduledDate, string memory _description)": This function allows the contract owner to create a new maintenance task for an elevator, specifying the elevator's address, scheduled maintenance date, and a description of the task.
"updateMaintenanceTask(uint _taskId, uint _newScheduledDate, string memory _newDescription)": This function allows the contract owner to update an existing maintenance task by providing the task ID, a new scheduled date, and a new description.
"getMaintenanceTask(uint _taskId)": This function allows anyone to retrieve the details of a specific maintenance task by providing its task ID. The function returns the elevator address, scheduled date, description, and completion status of the task.
"markTaskAsCompleted(uint _taskId)": This function allows the contract owner to mark a maintenance task as completed by providing the task ID.
"getNumberOfTasks()": This function allows anyone to retrieve the total number of maintenance tasks created in the contract.
The contract also emits events when certain actions are taken, allowing users to monitor and track updates:

"MaintenanceTaskCreated(uint indexed taskId, address indexed elevator, uint scheduledDate, string description)": This event is emitted when a new maintenance task is created.
"MaintenanceTaskUpdated(uint indexed taskId, uint newScheduledDate, string newDescription)": This event is emitted when an existing maintenance task is updated.
"MaintenanceTaskCompleted(uint indexed taskId)": This event is emitted when a maintenance task is marked as completed.
